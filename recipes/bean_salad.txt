This is basically "cowboy caviar' but without corn.

Ingredients:
1         can black beans
1         can chickpeas (or blackeyed peas, more traditionally)
.5        large red onion, diced
1         red bell pepper chopped/diced (substitute any sweet pepper you like)
2-4       cloves of garlic, minced/diced
bunch     parsley, chopped (substitute cilantro)
3-5 Tbsp. olive oil
1         jalapeno (optional; substitute hotter for more kick)
juice of 1 lemon (substitute lime)
pinch(es) of salt

Prep:
Combine all beans, onion, pepper, garlic in a large mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, whisk together oil and juice with a pinch of salt for dressing.
Gently stir dressing into mixing bowl with other ingredients until everything is nicely coated.
Gently stir in chopped herbs until evenly distributed.

Serve:
As a side to a main, or as a snack with tortilla chips (I go for multigrain or sweet potato tortilla chips).
I'll also just eat a bunch of this for lunch, as I'm always trying to drop my blood pressure/cut down on sat. fats.
