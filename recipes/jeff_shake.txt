Jeff's Ultimate Beefcake Shake

Base (~600 calories):
.5-1.0 tub greens
1.0        banana
1.0 cup    low-fat kefir/skyr/yogurt beverage
2 Tbsp     peanut butter
15-25g     powdered protein (most flavors work) 

Alternatives:
- remove kefir/skyr/yogurt to remove dairy
- remove peanut butter to drop fat content
- add seasonal berries

Notes:
This isn't necessarily the most efficient way to hit .5-1.0 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, but is a filling and healthy shake. Good breakfast to keep cravings down throughout the day.
